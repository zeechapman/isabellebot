# Isabelle Bot
## v3

When I first developed Isabelle Bot, I admittedly wrote a lot of it in a hurry, and didn't think I was going to do anything more advance than commands like `!caw` or `!hug`. Eventually, more and more commands and functionality was being added into Isabelle, and the code was getting a bit messy and harder to manage. This was when I did the first revision, where the code was refactored and restructured.

Although the code is easier and more maintainable, I've realized I can do a bit more with it, and make some other additional changes now that I've assigned the role of multiple bots into one single bot. One issue is the code is still a bit of a mess, and could use another revision. This would require me to re-write a lot, and I figured it would be easier to go back to square one again, and write everything over once more.

Instead of ditching version numbers originally, I'd like to consider this **Version 3**.
