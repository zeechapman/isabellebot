# IsabelleBot

This is a bot built specifically for a Discord server.

Pardon the mess.

### TODO:
- [ ] Find new home for Dad Bot commands (dadbot.js possibly)
- [ ] Clean up code more (may just be on-going)
- [ ] Add a wiki for documentation and other details relating to Isabelle Bot as a whole.
- [ ] Finish pattern checking function `ranCheck()` (also rename possibly)
